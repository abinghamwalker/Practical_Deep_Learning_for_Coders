# Practical Deep Learning for Coders - Course Materials

This repository contains all the lessons, code, and homework assignments from the [*Practical Deep Learning for Coders*](https://course.fast.ai/) course by fast.ai. The course is an excellent resource for learning deep learning concepts and applying them in practical scenarios.  I am using this repo to track my learning and homework in a single place and also so that I can run the notebooks in VSCode easily.
